Forked from [this](https://github.com/cemoody/topicsne) awesome implementation.

This repo has a simple t-SNE model implemented in pytorch; it uses the MNIST dataset for illustration.
You might need to install ``sklearn, matplotlib``. This t-sne folder is a little bit 
**out-dated**. For the newer version, check the `turbo-boost-detection` repo.  

The training dynamics is visualized below:
